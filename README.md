# TGDA
Tensor Grassmann Discriminant Analysis (TGDA)
We provide UTD-MHAD data set (mat file "HA.mat"). The data set was pre-processed by using a people detector. We also grayscaled and resized each video to 20×20×20. 
All tensor operators are in "wavelet.py" file. You can download all files and just run UTD-MHAD_kernel2.py to see classification performance of TGDA on UTD-MHDA database.
